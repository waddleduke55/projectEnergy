You can play around with the data models we have, you can add some instances. Enjoy!

The datasets are already loaded in the data folder, but to generate them:
- Open Rstudio, which you can get through Duke OIT VM Manage
- upload CS316_makeSchema.R, access-electricity.csv, and Power_Database.csv from Milestone2 in the same directory in Rstudio
- run CS316_makeSchema.R
- download Members.csv, Sellers.csv, Countries.csv from Rstudio into the data folder.

Note: after pulling current repository from GitHub, run the following two commands to synchronize the database:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
